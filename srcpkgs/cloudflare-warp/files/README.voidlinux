Before using cloudflare-warp on voidlinux, you need to enable warp-svc service:
```
ln -s /etc/sv/warp-svc /var/service/
```
If you want to see warp taskbar icon, you can add /usr/share/applications/com.cloudflare.WarpTaskbar.desktop to your autostart based on your desktop environment. This file must run by your regular user.
